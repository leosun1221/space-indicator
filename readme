Our ADO (Azure DevOps) build pipeline has already been upgraded to support both Node.js 14 and Node.js 18, ensuring compatibility across these versions. Since the process of sending WOF data is integrated into the build pipeline, it's essential to ensure the YAML configuration files are updated accordingly to reflect this compatibility. This will guarantee that the feature WOF implementation runs smoothly across the supported Node.js environments, maintaining consistency and performance in the build process.

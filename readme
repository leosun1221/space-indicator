We have introduced a new pull request (PR) template, currently implemented in the simple.demo project and integrated into our feature webx CLI project. For new projects, this PR template will be included automatically. However, for existing projects, the template needs to be added manually, as it is now a required part of the WOF assessment.

To add the PR template to your existing project, you have two options:

Manually copy the template folder from the simple.demo project.
Use the webx CLI command line tool. Please follow the instructions in the webx project documentation (a link will be provided).
Ensuring that the pull request template is integrated across all projects helps maintain consistent WOF evaluations and ensures adherence to the updated standards.

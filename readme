The new build pipeline introduces a feature that allows you to push WOF data to Kibana without needing to install the Kibana script directly in each feature project. This simplifies the process, as all you need to do is use the shared build pipeline. By leveraging the shared pipeline, WOF data will be automatically sent to Kibana, streamlining the setup and reducing maintenance efforts across projects.

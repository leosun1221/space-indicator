Managing and tracking the Feature WOF (Weight of Features) for our web projects has traditionally involved manually updating Excel sheets, which was both time-consuming and difficult to maintain. To streamline this process, we are introducing an automated solution that integrates directly into our ADO (Azure DevOps) build pipeline.

With this new implementation, a custom NPM package will be triggered automatically during the build process whenever a web feature project is pushed. This package will collect the necessary Feature WOF data and seamlessly send it to Kibana Elastic for better tracking, visualization, and management.

This approach eliminates the need for manual updates, ensures data accuracy, and provides real-time insights into feature performance through Kibana's powerful analytics tools.

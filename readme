Given that our company's Elastic data retention is limited to two months, we are exploring an alternative solution for long-term storage of our WOF data by utilizing SharePoint. Our plan is to create a SharePoint list page specifically for managing and storing Feature WOF information.

To make this work, we will trigger an email from Kibana that sends the Feature WOF data to our chapter's email. Using Power Automate, we will create a flow that triggers when the email is received. This flow will extract the WOF information from the email and automatically update the corresponding SharePoint list.

Additionally, we can extend this process by posting the WOF data to a Microsoft Teams channel or sending group messages, ensuring that all relevant teams are informed and the data is readily accessible. This approach ensures efficient data management and collaboration, while providing a reliable backup outside of Elasticâ€™s limited retention window.

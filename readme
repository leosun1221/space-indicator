We are planning to implement a WOF scoring system that will assess each feature based on its WOF configuration data. The scoring will classify features into three levels:

Green – indicating optimal or excellent performance.
Amber – signifying areas that need attention but are within acceptable limits.
Red – highlighting critical issues that require immediate action.
This rating system will provide clear, actionable insights into the health of each feature, making it easier to prioritize improvements and maintain overall project quality.

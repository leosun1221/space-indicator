We have introduced streamlined pull request (PR) validation steps to ensure the build validation process focuses only on the essential items. The key validation steps now include:

npm ci – for installing project dependencies.
npm run audit – to identify and address security vulnerabilities.
npm run build – to compile and build the project.
npm test – to execute unit tests and verify code functionality.
By refining these steps, we ensure the PR validation build runs efficiently, validating only the necessary components to maintain project quality and minimize overhead.

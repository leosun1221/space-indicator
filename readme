We have introduced a new pull request (PR) template, which is currently implemented in the simple.demo project and integrated into our feature webx CLI project. For new projects, this PR template will be automatically included, streamlining the development process. However, for existing projects, the template will need to be manually added.

As the pull request template is now a part of the WOF assessment, ensuring that it is implemented across all relevant projects is essential for consistent evaluation and adherence to standards. This will help maintain quality and compliance with the WOF framework.

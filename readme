We have introduced a new pull request (PR) validation step, requiring the inclusion of a work item URL in the PR description. This validation ensures that all pull requests reference a related work item, maintaining traceability and accountability.

As part of the build validation process, this new step ensures that only the necessary criteria are validated. The essential validation steps now include:

npm ci – for installing dependencies.
npm run audit – to check for vulnerabilities.
npm run build – to compile and build the project.
npm test – to run unit tests.
PR description validation – to verify the presence of a work item in the PR description.
By adding this new validation step, we ensure that the PR build validation process remains streamlined while enforcing critical checks to maintain code quality and process compliance.
